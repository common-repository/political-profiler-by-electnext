Automatically add data-rich, non-partisan profiles of U.S. politicians mentioned in your posts.

== Description ==

Attention political writers! Elevate your content and differentiate yourself from your pundit peers with the ElectNext Political Profiler.

Add comprehensive, data-driven, non-partisan profiles on any U.S. politicians to your posts. ElectNext's political "baseball cards" display up-to-date campaign finance, legislative, and biographical information, which is pulled in real-time from our databases for display on your site. We actively maintain profiles for over 10,000 politicians at the federal, state, and local levels.

The ElectNext Political Profiler is currently being used by some of the top news publishers in the country, including [The PBS NewsHour](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/), [Hearst](http://www.hearst.com/index2.php), and [The Philadelphia Inquirer](http://www.philly.com/).

After downloading the Political Profiler plugin, send an [email to our WordPress partnerships director](mailto:apikey@electnext.com?subject=WordPress%20plugin%20API%20key%20request) and let us know your site's domain name. Then we'll send you an API key which will give you access to our data. There is no fee and we do not display ads.

Then, you're ready to go!

When you write or edit a post, you will see an "ElectNext" meta box below your post editor. Use it to scan your text for politicians in our database, or enter the name of a politician in the search bar to add politician profiles to your post. You can also re-arrange or remove the profiles at any time.
